# vim: ft=gitconfig
# note: you can use the `includeIf` directive to conditionally include this file
# as part of your global git config depending on different circumstances. if say
# you have two github accounts for different repositories on the same computer,
# you can conditionally include a `user.email` in your global git config
# depending on which folder on your computer you're cd'd into (i.e. have a
# `~/personal` and `~/work` folder on your machine where git will include the
# personal email config if inside any subdirectory of `~/personal`). This
# directive is the "gitdir:/path/to/dir".
#
# i.e. [includeIf "gitdir:~/personal/"]
