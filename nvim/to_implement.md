# To implement in my Neovim config

## Yes please now this minute
- Refactor autopairs config
  * Add autopairs endwise config
- Setup some luasnip snippets for easier dev stuff
  * Make luasnip go to next insert point when completing an item with nvim-cmp
- Refactor completion/snippets file
  * Remove nvim-compe config
  * Document cmp.lua

## Loose Ideas
- Telescope extension for inserting react component based upon lsp server suggestions
- Mapping to get completion from lsp for react components, and complete them without typing angle brackets
